                        Hi, I'm Rafał. I specialize in computer hardware and the administration of Windows and Linux systems. I have experience in managing servers, networks, configuring Cisco devices, and working with SQL databases. I have theoretical knowledge of virtualization and containerization, as well as practical experience gained from home projects. 
                        <br><br>
                        My main goal is to gain experience and constantly improve my IT skills. I regularly expand my knowledge by learning new technologies and following the latest trends. I am ready for new challenges and always work hard to achieve my goals.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <img src="../images/system.jpeg" class="img_2">
                        Additionally, I have basic knowledge of Git/GitHub, HTML, CSS, and Java. My analytical approach to problems helps me learn how to diagnose and solve various IT issues. I pay great attention to creating accurate documentation, which makes work organization and problem-solving easier. 
                        <br><br>
                        I am constantly developing my skills in system administration, virtualization, containerization, and SQL databases, independently expanding my knowledge to become an even better specialist. I also hold the "Cybersecurity for Companies (Comarch) – Basics" certificate. More about me <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rafa%C5%82-walasek/" target="_blank">Linked In</a>.

                    <br><br>
                    <p>
                        Besides my technical skills, I stand out for my ability to work both in a team and independently, analytical thinking, and active listening. I focus on building positive relationships, and I am characterized by high personal culture, as well as punctuality and responsibility in completing assigned tasks.
